/*
* First Install all Packages

* open the File router.js (umiapp/src/pages/.umi/router.js ) in Text Editor (after I will explain why )

* If all is done
tap the command line :

- npm start 

to start to build and run the code 

* Return in the text Editor where router.js is located and tap (ctrl+z) to have the modifications I made in this file 

beacuse npm start command restore this file to his default values so some routes and path are not enumerated or are lost.

* start the server side (backend) in the folder  myapi 

****** notice that image ares stored dinamically in "assets/uploads/"  folder 

********************** That is my first Version of the work so my code smell bad I will make Changes and Correct other things In the next Commit *************************
